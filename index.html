            <h1>Ladino!</h1>
            <p>Ladino, also known by Judeo-Spanish and a myriad of other names, is the language originally spoken by the Jews that were expelled from Spain in 1492
			by the Spanish Inquisition.  Ladino is heavily based on Spanish, but also draws from many other languages as well, most notably Turkish, Greek, Slavic, Arabic,
			French, and Italian.  It is clear that the written language existed prior to the Inquisition, but it is more controversial as to whether the spoken language existed
			prior to then.  Scholars are split on the issue, but there seems to be evidence that it indeed existed before the Jew's exodus.  Unfortunately, the language has greatly
			decreased in popularity and is in danger of dying out.  Most people who speak are older and the language isn't being passed on to the younger generations.  
			Fortunately, as of about 20 years ago, Ladino seems to have entered a period of revival, particularly in the realm of music.  Ladino poems are particularly beautiful,
				and Ladino literature particularly insightful, so it is no surprise that people seem to enjoy them so much.

            <h3>Flory Jagoda <small>Guitarist, Composer, and Singer</h3></div>
            <p>Flory Jagoda was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, a member of the Sephardic Jewish community. When the Sephardic Jews were forced into exile from Spain and Portugal in the 15th century, many settled in other Mediterranean countries but preserved their native language, called Ladino. Through her grandmother, Jagoda learned songs that had been passed down in her family for generations. She also became familiar with the region's Balkan cultural traditions. Jagoda escaped the destruction of Sarajevo's Jewish community and came to the United States after World War II. She has been recognized as an important carrier of a unique musical heritage and also as a composer and arranger of new Sephardic songs. In addition to passing that tradition on to her children, she has taught many students who now perform Ladino music. Today, she tours widely and her music is circulated through recordings and in The Flory Jagoda Songbook. She is well known in the Washington, D.C. area for her willingness to perform at religious ceremonies, family celebrations and cultural events.</p>

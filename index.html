            <h1>The Ladino Language</h1>
            <p>Ladino, also known by Judeo-Spanish and several other names, is the language originally spoken by the Jews that were expelled from Spain in 1492 by the Spanish Inquisition.  It is clear that the written language existed prior to the Inquisition, but it is more controversial as to whether the spoken language existed prior to then.  Scholars are split on the issue, but there seems to be evidence that it indeed existed before the Jew's exodus.  Unfortunately, the language has greatly decreased in popularity and is in danger of dying out.  Most people who speak are older and the language isn't being passed on to the younger generations.  Fortunately, as of about 20 years ago, Ladino seems to have entered a period of revival, particularly in the realm of music.  Ladino songs and literature are particularly beautiful and insightful so it is no surprise that people seem to enjoy them so much. Ladino is heavily based on Spanish, but also draws from many other languages as well, most notably Turkish, Greek, Hebrew, Slavic, Arabic, French, and Italian.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Flory Jagoda was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, a member of the Sephardic Jewish community. When the Sephardic Jews were forced into exile from Spain and Portugal in the 15th century, many settled in other Mediterranean countries but preserved their native language, called Ladino. Through her grandmother, Jagoda learned songs that had been passed down in her family for generations. She also became familiar with the region's Balkan cultural traditions. Jagoda escaped the destruction of Sarajevo's Jewish community and came to the United States after World War II. She has been recognized as an important carrier of a unique musical heritage and also as a composer and arranger of new Sephardic songs. In addition to passing that tradition on to her children, she has taught many students who now perform Ladino music. Today, she tours widely and her music is circulated through recordings and in The Flory Jagoda Songbook. She is well known in the Washington, D.C. area for her willingness to perform at religious ceremonies, family celebrations and cultural events.</p>

              <p> Ramón Tasat was born in Bueno Aires and was taught Ladino by his grandmother at a young age.  It is said that "his style reflects the rich history and drama of this extraordinary culture. "  Tasat has a PhD in voice performance from the University of Texas at Austin and has played throughout Europe with Dr. Robert Shaw, one of the United States' most renowned musicians.  Tasat has recorded a multitude of albums, including a series of duets with Flory Yagoda.  Here is a video of Tasat performing "Adío Kerida", a famous Ladino song which I have had the pleasure of singing in my Ladino class at Tufts University.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Esher Ofarim was born in Safed, Israel, to a Syrian Jewish family, and as such, was influenced by the Sephardic culture. She sang Hebrew and international folk songs from a young age, and in 1960 played a minor part in the 1960 epic war film, <i>Exodus</i>.  From 1961 to 1966 she experienced a period of great musical success, and approached stardom when she and her husband recorded <i>Morning of my life</i> in 1967, written by the Bee Gees.  After divorcing from her husband in 1970, Ofarim has done several solo recordings and continues to have success.  In 1984, she sang in <i>Ghetto</i>, a play about the Jewish life during World War II.  Most recently, in 2004  her songs were featured in <i>Walk on Water</i>, a critically acclaimed Israeli film.</p>
